## GE_transfer
Exploration of transfer credit trends in some General Education courses at Ferris State University. This repo contains a variety of files that I use to explore this issue and present the finding of my analysis. Those files are briefly identified below:

_bigTable.csv_	- a data file of the transfer credits by year, semester, and program (I generated this from a large database using an R script prior to this analysis).  

_index.Rmd_	My slidify slide deck for the project.  

_index.html_	The actual slidify deck. This can be viewed live in the gh-pages branch of this repo.  

_index.md_ The markdown document generated by RStudio during the production of the slidify deck.  

_server.R_ The server file for my Shiny app  

_shiny-transfers.Rproj_	The RStudio project file for this work.  

_top.csv_	Another data table that I generated prior to this analysis. This one gives the number of transfer credits for the top ten General Education courses.  

_ui.R_ The user interface file for my Shiny app.
