## GE_transfer
Exploration of transfer credit trends in some General Education courses at Ferris State University. This repo contains a variety of files that I use to explore this issue and present the finding of my analysis. Those files are briefly identified below:

_*bigTable.csv*_	- a data file of the transfer credits by year, semester, and program (I generated this from a large database using an R script prior to this analysis).  

_*index.Rmd*_	My slidify slide deck for the project.  

_*index.html*_	The actual slidify deck. This can be viewed live in the gh-pages branch of this repo.  

_*index.md*_ The markdown document generated by RStudio during the production of the slidify deck.  

_*server.R*_ The server file for my Shiny app  

_*shiny-transfers.Rproj*_	The RStudio project file for this work.  

_*top.csv*_	Another data table that I generated prior to this analysis. This one gives the number of transfer credits for the top ten General Education courses.  

_*ui.R*_ The user interface file for my Shiny app.
