## GE_transfer
Exploration of transfer credit trends in some General Education courses at Ferris State University. This repo contains a variety of files that I use to explore this issue and present the finding of my analysis. Those files are briefly identified below:

*bigTable.csv*	- a data file of the transfer credits by year, semester, and program (I generated this from a large database using an R script prior to this analysis).
*index.Rmd*	My slidify slide deck for the project. 
*index.html*	The actual slidify deck. This can be viewed live in the gh-pages branch of this repo.
*index.md* The markdown document generated by RStudio during the production of the slidify deck.
*server.R* The server file for my Shiny app
*shiny-transfers.Rproj*	The RStudio project file for this work.
*top.csv*	Another data table that I generated prior to this analysis. This one gives the number of transfer credits for the top ten General Education courses.
*ui.R* The user interface file for my Shiny app.
